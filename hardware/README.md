# Hardware

This folder contains all mechanical components required to build the throttle control system.

## Contents

- 3D printable parts for servo mounting and linkage
- Full CAD assembly files
- Assembly reference images

## Manufacturing

Parts are designed for FDM 3D printing.

Recommended materials:
- PLA or PETG for prototypes
- PETG or ABS for engine-mounted parts

Minor dimensional adjustments may be required depending on printer tolerances.

## Assembly Notes

- Servo position may be adjusted depending on carburetor geometry.
- Linkage rod lengths may vary per engine configuration.
- Ensure free throttle movement before engine operation.
