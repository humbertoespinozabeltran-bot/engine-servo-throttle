# Future Work

While the current system demonstrates a functional mechanical and control prototype, several improvements are planned.

## Mechanical Improvements

- Optimization of servo mount stiffness
- Compact linkage designs
- Universal mounting kit for additional engine models
- Integration of vibration-resistant mounts

## Electronics Expansion

- Closed-loop throttle control
- RPM feedback control
- Wireless control capability
- Fail-safe throttle return mechanisms

## Firmware Enhancements

- Governor-assisted control logic
- PID throttle control
- Remote monitoring
- Engine automation modes

## Testing and Validation

Future work includes:

- Real engine testing
- Long-term durability evaluation
- Thermal and vibration impact studies

## Alternative Design Exploration

Future revisions may explore:

- Cable-driven throttle actuation
- Dual-servo redundant control
- Fully enclosed actuator systems

The project is intended to evolve into a universal engine automation platform.
