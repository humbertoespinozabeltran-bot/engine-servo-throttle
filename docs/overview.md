# Project Overview

This project implements a universal servo-based throttle control system for small utility engines such as the Predator 212 and Honda GX200 families.

The system combines a mechanical linkage assembly with a microcontroller-controlled servo to accurately control engine throttle position while maintaining compatibility with the factory governor mechanism.

The design focuses on practicality and reproducibility. All mechanical parts are designed to be manufactured through 3D printing and assembled using commonly available hardware components.

The project includes:

- Servo mounting structure compatible with common carburetors
- Linkage system synchronized with governor and throttle plate
- Air filter mounting compatibility
- ESP32-based control firmware
- Modular design adaptable to different engine configurations

The goal is to provide a robust base platform for engine automation, remote control vehicles, experimental projects, and educational engineering applications.

Current status: functional CAD prototype and validated kinematic system.
